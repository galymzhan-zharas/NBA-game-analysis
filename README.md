# Welcome to My NBA game analysis
***

## Task
The task is to read the report collected during a basketball game, retrieve specific data from it, and display the 
retrieved data according to the given standard

## Description
To solve the problem, first off, I have read the .txt file and stored the data in an array. 

Then, I have reformatted the array to display the collected data of individual teams separately. 
    To do that, I have parsed through the data searching for players belonging to individual teams. 
    Then, I have computed the scores of each player of the team based on what he did. 

At the end, I have displayed the data from the previous operation as a table with the total scores of each team.
